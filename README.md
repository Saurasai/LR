# Ecommerce Customer Data Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze customer data for an **Ecommerce company** based in **New York City**. The company sells clothing online and provides in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers can visit the store for sessions with a personal stylist and then place orders through either a **mobile app** or **website**.

## Objective
The primary objective of this analysis is to help the Ecommerce company decide whether to focus their efforts on improving the **mobile app experience** or the **website**. By analyzing customer data, including **usage patterns, purchase history, demographics**, etc., we aim to identify key insights that will inform the company's strategic decision-making process.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains anonymized information about customer interactions with the **Ecommerce platform**. It includes data on **customer demographics, session durations, pages visited, purchase history**, device types used (mobile app or website), etc.

## Methodology
We will employ **linear regression analysis** to gain insights into the factors that influence customer behavior and preferences on the mobile app and website platforms. This will involve identifying relevant independent variables (such as session duration, number of pages visited, etc.) and their impact on the dependent variable (e.g., purchase amount).

## Key Findings
Based on our linear regression analysis, we will summarize **key findings** and insights regarding the factors that influence customer purchase behavior on the mobile app and website platforms. This will include identifying significant predictors of purchase amount and understanding how these variables interact with each other.

## Recommendations
Finally, we will provide **recommendations** to the Ecommerce company based on our findings from the linear regression analysis. These recommendations will inform the company's decision on whether to prioritize improving the mobile app experience, the website, or both platforms. We will also suggest specific strategies and initiatives that the company can undertake to enhance the overall customer experience and drive business growth.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this analysis aims to provide valuable insights and recommendations to the Ecommerce company, enabling them to make informed decisions regarding their platform optimization strategy.
