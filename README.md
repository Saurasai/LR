# House Price Prediction with Linear Regression

This project implements a simple linear regression model to predict house prices based on various features. The dataset used for training and testing the model is the [XYZ dataset](link_to_dataset), which contains information about houses such as the number of bedrooms, size of the house, location, etc.

## Introduction
In this project, we aim to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the prices of houses based on certain features. This can be useful for real estate agents, homeowners, and buyers to estimate the value of a property.

## Installation
To run this project locally, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install these dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory. Run the following command to execute the code:
```bash
python house_price_prediction.py
```

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about houses including features like the number of bedrooms, size of the house, location, etc. It consists of two main files: `train.csv` and `test.csv`. The training dataset is used to train the model, while the test dataset is used to evaluate its performance.

## Features
The features used for predicting house prices include:
- Number of bedrooms
- Size of the house (in square feet)
- Location (latitude and longitude)
- Distance to the nearest school, hospital, etc.

## Model Training
We use a simple linear regression model to train our data. The model is trained on the training dataset using the features mentioned above.

## Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

## Results
The trained model achieves an MAE of X, MSE of Y, and R-squared of Z on the test dataset.

## Future Improvements
- Explore more advanced regression techniques such as polynomial regression or ensemble methods.
- Include additional features such as neighborhood crime rates, proximity to public transportation, etc.
- Fine-tune hyperparameters to improve model performance.
